This project contains three files related to a research project evaluating linguistic differences between two corpuses (large amounts of text). This code was used to evaluate differences in linguistic choices between female, male, underrepresented and non-underrepresented medical trainees, although they could be applied toward other applications. 

The files work with Python and the NLTK and Spacy packages.

The code will enable you to calculate TF-IDF, as well as the odd ratios for particular word stems.
